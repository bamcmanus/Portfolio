                        Brent McManus is a California transplant who moved to Oregon in 2002 when he enrolled at the
                        University of Oregon.  He graduated with a Bachelor of Science in human physiology in 2006.  His
                        passion in the field led him to open a CrossFit gym.  Life is crazy and plans change, however.
                        His next adventure took him to Fort Polk Louisiana, where he spent seven years as an infantryman
                        in the United States Army.  He completed two deployments to Afghanistan where he learned that all
                        the "stresses of life" truly don't matter.  Life is short and you have to enjoy what you do.  Because
                        of this, after his time in the military, he decided to pursue his interest in computer programming.
                        His spouse's family brought he and his family back to Oregon, this time Portland.  He plans to
                        complete his Masters of Science in computer science in June of 2019.  He contributes to "keeping it
                        weird" by shooting his bow, visiting Rose City Comic-Con in cosplay with his family, cheering on
                        the Timebers and Thorns, spending time with his daughters at Rose City Futsal and painfully enduring
                        Bravo TV due to his wife's obsession.
